      <description>To continue from last time: we need to create some vault policy to allow terraform to create child tokens. Thanks to (tyrannosauraus-becks )[https://github.com/tyrannosaurus-becks], who suggests to add this policy to the github users that we have previously created:
path &amp;ldquo;auth/token/create&amp;rdquo; { capabilities = [&amp;ldquo;create&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;update&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;delete&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo;] }
Huh, look at that, it worked. It&amp;rsquo;s nice when things work the first time! Now to rid our repos of secrets!</description>

      <description>DevOps engineer is a bit of a misnomer. Really, it should be broken into two main functions: platform engineering and platform automation. Platform engineering being &amp;ldquo;get k8s running so they can deploy their workload&amp;rdquo;, and platform automation being &amp;ldquo;magic up a way we don&amp;rsquo;t need to manually provision environments any more&amp;rdquo;.
This post definitely fits firmly into the second one. In a lot of cases, developers have access to modify AWS, to the build system, create repos.</description>

      <description>Storing secrets in git is bad. Github even has ([automated secret scanning)[https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-secret-scanning] to try and combat this. The worst bit is having years of security debt, like secrets in git, and needing to put them somewhere more secure. This post details some of the trials we have gone through to fix this issue, as well as our approach and why we think it was a good way to go.
iac infrastructure as code is the standard way to deploy infrastructure, since it&amp;rsquo;s repeatable, clean, and can be source controlled.</description>
