      <description>DevOps engineer is a bit of a misnomer. Really, it should be broken into two main functions: platform engineering and platform automation. Platform engineering being &amp;ldquo;get k8s running so they can deploy their workload&amp;rdquo;, and platform automation being &amp;ldquo;magic up a way we don&amp;rsquo;t need to manually provision environments any more&amp;rdquo;.
This post definitely fits firmly into the second one. In a lot of cases, developers have access to modify AWS, to the build system, create repos.</description>

This post details some of the trials we have gone through to fix this issue, as well as our approach and why we think it was a good way to go.
#iac infrastructure as code is the standard way to deploy infrastructure, since it&amp;rsquo;s repeatable, clean, and can be source controlled.</description>
